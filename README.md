The combination of a good theme with a unique and comfortable [config](./user.js) for both [Nebula](https://github.com/JustAdumbPrsn/Zen-Nebula) and the browser.

## ðŸ¤– Setup

Clone this repository and follow the steps.

> [!WARNING]
> I recommend that you install this complete theme and its settings after synchronizing your Zen Browser account.

1. Copy [user.js](./user.js) and paste it into your Zen Browser profile.
2. Copy the entire directory named [chrome](./chrome/) to your Zen Browser profile for colored icons.
3. Go to [Sine's Github](https://github.com/CosmoCreeper/Sine) and follow its installation process.
   - This includes downloading and setting up FX-Autoconfig using the auto installer or manual installation.
   - Then setting up Sine.
   - Now search for [Nebula](https://github.com/JustAdumbPrsn/Zen-Nebula) in the **Sine Mods**, it will be there.

ðŸ”¥ It should be working now.
